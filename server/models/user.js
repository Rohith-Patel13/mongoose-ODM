/*
Mongoose lets you start using your models immediately, without waiting
for mongoose to establish a connection to MongoDB.
Thatâ€™s because mongoose buffers model function calls internally.
This buffering is convenient, but also a common source of confusion.
Mongoose will not throw any errors by default if you use a model without connecting.
